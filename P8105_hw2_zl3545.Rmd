# Problem 1

## Load dataset

```{r load_data, message = FALSE}
subway_df = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line:entry | vending | ada) |> 
  mutate(entry = case_match(entry, 
                            "YES" ~ TRUE,
                            "NO" ~ FALSE))

subway_df
```
This dataset contains the following variables that describe the NYC subway 
entrance and exit system: `r colnames(subway_df)`. After loading the dataset, 
`clean_names()` was applied to convert column names to snake case, `select()` 
was applied to retain columns desired, and `mutate()` was applied to convert 
the data type of the `entry` column from `chr` to `lgl`. The dataset after 
tidying up has a dimension of `r dim(subway_df)`.
